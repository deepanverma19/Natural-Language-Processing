Options for Python SOLR interface:

1) Official SOLR page - HTTP Queries/JSON Response.
	https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_1/using-python.html
	Python 3 code mentioned in the comments.
	
2) Official SOLR page - Python Response Writer
	https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_1/response-writers.html#python-response-writer
	Same as option 1 above but has the following changes:
		-true and false changed to True and False
		-Python unicode strings are used where needed
		-ASCII output (with unicode escapes) is used for less error-prone interoperability
		-newlines are escaped
		-null changed to None
		
3) Official SOLR page - Python JDBC connection
	https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_1/solr-jdbc-python-jython.html
	Basically we can connect to SOLR and interact to it like a database.

4) PySOLR
	https://github.com/django-haystack/pysolr
	Here is the link to the actual pysolr Python file.  You may be able to extract some information from here on how to use it:
	https://github.com/django-haystack/pysolr/blob/master/pysolr.py

5) SolrClient
	https://github.com/moonlitesolutions/SolrClient
	It is only up to version 0.2.1, so I am not sure how much functionality it has.  Last update to Github was 8 months ago.
	It does have decent documentation though: http://solrclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
	
6) SOLRPy
	https://pythonhosted.org/solrpy/
	It has some documentation.  The reference section might be helpful: https://pythonhosted.org/solrpy/reference.html
	
7) Scorched
	https://github.com/lugensa/scorched
	Not sure about this one... only version 0.12.1

8) SolrQ
	http://solrq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
	Also not sure about this one... syntax looks strange, but it might work.
